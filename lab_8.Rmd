```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, 
                      message = FALSE, 
                      warning = FALSE,
                      fig.width = 6.5, 
                      fig.height = 8)

```



```{r commit 1}
star <- import(here("data", "star.csv"))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
